  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <br>
  I am a 5th year economics PhD student at the University of Delaware with research interests in labor economics, the economics of education, and development economics. My job market paper focuses on how the military conscription policy in Ukraine incentivized higher educational attainment in times of political instability (and continues to do so today). I am not just interested in the economics of higher education, however. The groundwork for success in the labor market is created at the K-12 level and I am interested in further exploring policies that not only improve academic achievement, but promote student well-being and foster a lifelong love of learning.
