  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <br>
  I am a 5th year economics graduate student at the University of Delaware with research interests in the economics of education, labor economics, and development economics.<br>
  My job market paper focuses on how the military conscription policy in Ukraine incentivized higher educational attainment in times of political instability (and continues to do so today). <br>
